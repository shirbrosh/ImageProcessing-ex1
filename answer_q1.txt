Q1: If a division will have a gray level segment with no pixels,
    the procedure will crash. why??

Answer: the formula for calculating the q_i is: sum of all z's between each z_i to z_i+1
    multiply the p(z) for each one divided by the sum of all p(z) between z_i to z_i+1.
    if a division will have a gray level segment with no pixels the sum of all p(z)
    between z_i to z_i+1 will be zero (since p(z) is the amount of pixels and we have
    no pixels). in this case while calculating q and operating the formula mentioned
    above, we will be dividing by zero- which will cause the procedure to crash.
