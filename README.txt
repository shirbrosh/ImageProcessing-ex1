
Instructions

1. Extract eitan_kali_test.py to your main code directory (or in another directory, but remember to
   change the running directory in run configurations).
2. Extract the "externals" directory to your main directory. You can add more .jpg files to test in
   that folder.
3. Run the test.

* You can change the "externals" directory name, and also change that part of the test (PATH).
* You can uncomment the "raise" in check_mono_dec do make the test fail and not just print errors.
